# EuclidOS
EuclidOS is a modern, free, and open-source graphing calculator OS. Currently, the OS can do basic arithmetics, store variables, and work with matrices. It can also graph, but only in y=mx+b form. Due to UI issues, graphing is currently unavailable.

## Installation/Usage
This will require at least JDK 1.8 or OpenJDK. Currently, this OS has no GUI, is only using a CLI for basic arithmetic, and needs much more work before being available for public use.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Help is especially needed for UI/GUI. We would like to use Java Swing and make the GUI components modular.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
